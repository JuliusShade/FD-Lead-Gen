// DEBUG VERSION - Shows the invisible bridge area for troubleshooting
// Uncomment the background color in the main component to see the bridge area

// This debug version shows the bridge area as a semi-transparent red overlay
// To enable debugging in the main component:
// 1. Open TableCellWithLinks.tsx
// 2. Find the bridge div (around line 230)
// 3. Uncomment the line: // background: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)",
// 4. The bridge area will now be visible as a light red overlay

DEBUG MODE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To see the invisible bridge area:
   - Open TableCellWithLinks.tsx
   - Find line ~230 with comment "// background: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)","
   - Uncomment that line
   - The bridge will show as a light red area

2. Test the interaction:
   - Hover over a cell with URLs
   - You should see the popover appear
   - Move your mouse slowly toward the popover
   - The red bridge area should keep the popover visible
   - Once you reach the popover, it should stay stable

3. If the popover still disappears:
   - Check console for any errors
   - Verify the bridge area covers the path from cell to popover
   - Ensure there are no gaps in the hover detection

4. Current hover logic:
   - isHoveringCell: true when mouse is over the table cell
   - isHoveringPopover: true when mouse is over popover OR bridge
   - showPopover: visible when either hover state is true
   - 200ms delay before hiding when both hover states are false
